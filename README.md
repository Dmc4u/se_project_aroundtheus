# Project 3, Title: Around The U.S.

Profile Title: Jacques Cousteau
Description: Explorer

## Project Key Features.

# HTML Structure:

1. Semantic structure with <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>.
2. Templates using <template> for dynamic card generation.
3. Flexbox layout for flexible and responsive design.
4. Grid layout for creating structured, two-dimensional layouts.
5. Responsive Design using @media queries to optimize for different screen sizes.

# CSS Design:

1. Popup animations with smooth transitions for opening/closing.
2. Responsive design with media queries for smaller screens.
3. Custom error and validation styles for forms.

# JavaScript Logic:

1. Modular approach with Card and FormValidator classes.
2. Real-time validation of form inputs.
3. Reusable utility functions for popups and event listeners.
4. Rendering of initial cards and adding new ones dynamically.

# Accessibility:

1. Popup close functionality supports the Escape key and overlay clicks.
2. Alt attributes for images ensure accessibility.

#### Future Improvements.

# Accessibility Enhancements:

1. Add ARIA roles and attributes (e.g., role="dialog", aria-labelledby, aria-describedby) to modals for better screen reader support.
2. Include focus trapping within modals to prevent tab navigation outside the modal.

# User Feedback:

1. Add visual feedback for successful operations like card addition or profile updates.
2. Display error messages more descriptively.

# Code Organization:

1. Separate CSS into modular files (e.g., popup.css, card.css).
2. Use ES6+ modules for better maintainability (e.g., utility functions in a separate file).

# Performance Optimization:

1. Lazy-load images for cards to optimize page load speed.
2. Use a build tool like Webpack to bundle and minify assets.

# Scalability:

1. Implement a backend API for storing cards and user profile information.
2. Add authentication for user-specific content.
